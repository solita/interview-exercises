# Python base pack

This folder contains a very minimal, lightweight hello world application that can be ran and tested with Python.

## Prerequisites

Clone this repository from git. You do not need to fork it, or send your code anywhere, just clone the code for the live coding exercise.

You should have Python3 installed.
Python version does not matter much, as long as it is at least Python 3.7.
Most important thing is that your installation is set up so you can test and run Python code.

You probably want to have an IDE installed, any of them will work, but if you want a suggestion,
we would recommend IntelliJ Idea Community Edition or VS Code.
If you already love Netbeans, Eclipse, Emacs, Vim, or have written your own IDE, by all means bring that along.

## Am I ready for the interview?

It's recommended to run this in a virtual environment.

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

You are ready for the interview, when you can run these operations, either from command line or from your favourite IDE:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
python main.py
```

Done with all that! Congratulations! Now we can start coding immediately with your working environment.
If you want to prepare for the interview, brush up on your basic Python and unit test skills a bit, then come with a relaxed attitude.
Purpose is not to do any challenging coding, purpose is just to chat by some code, to get to know each others as coders.
It's like fireside chat - just with less fire and more Python hopefully!
